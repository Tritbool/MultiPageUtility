# MultiPageUtility
C# and Windows Form Application developed for XPERTEAM during my first year of MIAGE Master's degree internship.

#Purpose
This application converts any ASPX file containing a telerik RadMultiPage to XML.
Once this conversion done, the XML is converted to a new ASPX file, according to a predefined template using
an N-ary tree and a factory.

#Also
Hence, it is possible to reuse the application's code to convert any ASPX file to any other XML or ASPX file.
